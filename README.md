# Starlink_Simulation_Dataset
This dataset is based on Starlink. First, the Starlink scene is constructed using STK, and the construction parameters are shown in the table below.
| Name      | Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Orbit Planes      | 72       |
| Satellite Per Orbit   | 22       |
| Altitude      | 550 km       |
| Satellite Per Orbit   | 12.88 dBW/MHz       |
| G/T      | 13.7 dB/K      |
| Ground Communication Range Radius   | 573.5 km       |
| Farthest Connection Distance      | 794.6 km     |
| Downlink Speed   | 50 Mbps    |
| Modulation Method      | QPSK    |
| Frequency   | 12.0 GHz   |
| Date   | 8â€“9 December 2020 |
| Data Interval  | 1 s  |

The connection data of the satellite is exported for STK. The scene created is shown below:
